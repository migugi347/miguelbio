    <h1>Reflections on Media Categorization</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Identified Common Themes</h2>
        <p>In reviewing the assignments of my peers, I've identified several common themes in how we categorize and
            interact with media. These insights have prompted me to reconsider my own media categorization framework.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Theme 1: Fast media vs. Traditional Media</strong> - Many students, including <a
                    href="https://finnyear.github.io">Finn</a> and <a href="https://umaesarkar.wixsite.com/home">Uma
                </a>, discussed
                the diffuciulty of using traditional forms of media such as text or books and rather rely of video
                content or shorter forms of content to digest.</li>
            <li><strong>Theme 2: Supported Systems</strong> - These students disccuss simmilarities between their
                preffered form of media such as
                <a href="https://people.tamu.edu/~jose_montenegro/">Mateo</a> who liked viewing films and <a
                    href="https://nikkiraww.wixsite.com/csce445">Nikki</a> who enjoys playing video games, both
                highlight
                how their experieces were enhanced
                by supporting system such as a community or technological support play crucial roles in maximizing the
                enjoyment.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Theme 3: Overconsumption</strong> - The overconsumption of media was discussed <a
                    href="https://mathewakhil.github.io">Akhil</a> and <a
                    href="https://nebiyouersabo.github.io/445-Assignment-1/">Neb</a>, sharing how easy it was to become
                stuck in a loop while using media.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Revisions to My Media Categorization</h2>
        <p>After relfecting on the common themes I read over, I propose certain revisions to my media categorization:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>I would incorporate <strong>Tradtional and Fast Media</strong>, recognizing the the preference for
                easily digestable, vidoe based
                content over more conventional formats. .</li>
            <li>I would also expand certian media by the <strong> supported systems </strong> acknowledging how films
                and video games benefit
                from the enahncemens provided by a community and technological support.</li>
            <li>Lastly id address the issue of <strong>Overconsumption</strong>, adding a focus on media that could
                posssibly be addictive and the importance of mindful
                practices to avoid getting into unproductive loops</li>
        </ul>
