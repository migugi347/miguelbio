# Zenji: Enhancing Kanji Learning with Artificial Intelligence

Every project has its unique charm and at Zenji, we bring together the elegance of Japanese characters and the precision of machine learning. Our application provides real-time feedback on written Kanji, facilitating a deeper understanding and mastery of Japanese writing.

## Project Overview

Zenji incorporates a dual-approach system combining heuristic algorithms and a machine learning model to enhance user interaction and learning efficiency. The heuristic model provides immediate grading and feedback on user-written Kanji, while the machine learning component, developed using TensorFlow, activates computer vision to offer suggestions and recognize character details. This sophisticated system not only improves the accuracy of character recognition but also tailors the learning experience to individual progress, significantly boosting the users' ability to refine their Kanji skills.
