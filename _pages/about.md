I'm currently studying at Texas A&M University and pursuing a
Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Excited to learn more about software and new people after graduation!

I am an innovative programmer with a keen interest in artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning. My background includes both backend and frontend development, with solid skills in Python and C++. As a collaborative team player, I excel in sharing ideas and crafting creative solutions. I thrive under pressure, consistently meeting deadlines, and am eager for a role where I can apply my skills to meaningful projects, including in design, implementation, testing, and debugging.
